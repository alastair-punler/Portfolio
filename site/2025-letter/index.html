        <h2>2025 Annual Letter</h2>

        <p>Hola Amigos, <br><br>
          After a year hiatus the letter is back. For those new to the letter the concept is a year's recap, a bit of reflection to share with friends like an old school Christmas card of our parents' generation.
           Theres only two problems, its gonna be late and it’s a bit of ramble so bear with me. This year also takes a new format hosting it on my website, this was a fresh idea to make it more interactive and support
           some of my learning goals. Theres a spotify playlist of my favourite songs this year and all the photos you can click on them to enlarge. So press play and enjoy the ride.

          <br>
          This years again is exceptionally late due the whirlwind of the back end of 2025 and start of 2026. 
          I write to you currently whilst on a day trip to the Mexican Embassy in Miami from Mexico city to get my work visa, 
          whilst on my first rotation to my new job in Mexico, but more on that later.
          <br> <br>
          2025 was a very rich year, I feel like there was so much and a lot of overseas trips to cover that this needs  disclaimer: 
          some of the time in Perth doesn’t get enough air time this year, but I still love being in Perth, I still live in West Perth despite bold ambitions to move to Subiaco,
           the favourite spots remain the same: The Bowlo West Leedy, JB orilleys for steak special and Bagelo Subiaco to mention a few. 
          <br> <br>
          The year opens up post NYE celebrations in Kendenup, WA camping on Grace's family farm with a gorgeous view of the Stirling ranges.
           To make it even better my lone friend from my time in the Lone star state, Cal was here to visit and had spent NYE celebrating with my friends in this exceptional part of the world. 
           Cal departed shortly into the new year on a grand adventure before starting a new job in Stamford, Connecticut just north of NYC - where I need to return the favour and visit!

           Q1 was rather electric, I was away on a lot of trip and I was in a phase of making merchandise for some of these group trips/milestone events.  
           First up was a long weekend in Bali for Liam Gallaghers Bucks, which was a hectic 4 days. Getting to some of Liams friends from Brisbane where he now resides was great but 
           I'll never forget meeting his rogue mate Tom. It was something you'd expect from Trevor out of GTA 5, I walked into the villa and this rouge bloke with a mullet was shooting fireworks at the groom. I instantly knew I was in for a weekend of debauchery. I had also made some custom kits for the group based on Celtic soccer jersey which were a conversation starter for sure. Golf, Bintangs, late night villa hangs, pit vipers, shit kits, Finns, terrible bartering skills and too many visits to Hotel Mexicola, and 1x dislocated shoulder.  That pretty much sums it up.

            Q1 also had some notable home highlights, Hottest 100 at Jivan's, an excellent Kaytranada gig, Wildands (feat more custom merch) and the final day of the rugby 7s before departing 
            on a 3 week ski trip to Canada.

          <br><br>
            This ski trip is one of the major highlights of my year so there will be a bit of detail below. The original plan was to spend a week at Sun Peaks, BC to celebrate the 30th of a dear friend of mine Sam Rosser 
            and I build in as much skiing as I could to the entire trip. After an overnight in Sydney due to Weather, I was due to arrive a day later than planned to Whistler where I had assembled and assorted crew.
            Alex and Dani (travelling from Houston where Alex is working for woodside), Matt and Mel (acquaintances through Sam soon to become friends) and Steph (Lives in Vancouver friends with Dani from Mercy Ships Senegal). My late arrival and determination to ski
            resulted in me landing at 6am in Vancouver well refreshed after sleeping 14hrs straight, jumping on the 2hr bus and being on the slopes by 10am same day to rip Whistler for the first time. Conditions were average but the company was excellent, one of my core memories will started a random snowball fight down the main street giggling/gasping for air the whole way home. 
            It was such a lovely time with an assorted group that even featured Jackson (another woodside colleague who happened to be in town) and his rogue mate from Karratha. Then two real pivotal events happened: 
            
            <ol>
              <li>Alex and Dani got engaged!</li>
              <li>It started dumping snow for our last day.</li>
            </ol>
            
            Now look I get it engagements are important but Dani and Alex y'all can wait till the end of this letter for this spotlight, you got engaged and married in the same year. 
            <br><br>
            The last day skiing in whistler was superb and I was very lucky to have 2 very keen skiers also present, Steph and Matt were both excellent skiers who realised this was the chance. We were up very early, waited in line for the lifts had a mammoth day on the slopes, my knees and quads were begging for mercy.

            <br><br>
            We then made the transit to Vancouver to rejoin the 15+ people all going to Sun Peaks for Sams Birthday, one big night at the Yale Saloon, where my friends had actually found a family friend and one hungover long ass bus ride we were at Sun peaks in our assorted houses.
            The 7 days was awesome, again not ideal conditions, -30, no snow but its impossible not to have fun with a massive group in a ski town, in matching jumpers? Oh yeah merch item number 2, by far the sickest. I made the quarter zips saying Rosser alpine club and we convinced people at the local bar we were the Bluff knoll ski club.
            Group end of day laps, evenings at bottoms bar, group cooking and fines night at the house were some all time fave moments. It was an assorted group but everyone came together super well and there was some excellent skiers. 
            Next up was a one day transit to Calgary followed by a night at the Saddledome watching the Calgary flames with friends from Calgary, then onward to Fernie to rip it for another week.

            <br><br>
            In Fernie I linked up with friends and family and boy did the snow come down to make it a ripper week. We also had the pleasure of watching the 4 Nations hockey tournament showing the best on best hockey since the 2014 winter olympics. 
            Where were you when there as 3 fights in the first 5 seconds of the Canada Vs USA round robin game? I was sitting in my parents living room smashing beers with Simon Kudla. That was a lot about the ski trip but it was genuinely all time - I did something like 17days skiing in the 20 days I was in Canada, and skied on fly in and fly out day - crazy shit.

            After getting home the Q1 fun didn’t stop, I had Liam and Tash Gallaghers wedding which was a beautiful event that included some bagpipe performances from AFR recognisable individuals. 
            I still don’t know how to tie a bow tie though. Soon after I wrapped up Q1 with a long weekend trip to Bali with the hockey boys for Seans birthday which was awesome fun at an amazing villa, Got to see concerts from Tyler Childers and Cody Johnson, 
            The Golf Gamers Association Sandbagger Golf Tournament (again some custom merch was on display) and had a cute weekend in Rottnest for the Rotto swim with Sam, Emily, Marthy, Andy and Sorcha and her Irish gang.

            <br><br>
            Q2 mandates the start of the Perth Thunder season and this year also coincided with a ramp up in my load at work, two conflicting items that I think I juggled well given the demands. 
            <br><br>
            Lets start with the work component. I was able to step up much more this year at work owning my own well (a problem well that I had to design full remediation scope for) and execute the design whilst managing a few hiccups a long the way. 
            I am super appreciative to my colleague Yvan who is a really smart dude from Trinidad/Houston was on secondment to Australia for a couple years, he was a really good mentor and someone I'm glad to call my friend. 
            It was great to see out the Scarborough drilling campaign I had been working on for the last 2 years on such a high note, in 2024 it was a real struggle and everything was going wrong but in 2025 we started to see some of the rewards from our hard work. 
            All in all this year was a big growth year for my career that set up with both a promotion and a new opportunity in Mexico for 2026. More on that later. 
            <br><br>
            The 2025 Perth Thunder season was a mixed bag. I found out very late in the piece the team had decided to go with 2x import defenseman essentially punting me out of the line up, when we had a full squad. They good news was we rarely had a full squad so I did get to play,
             but it was definitely a step backward from previous seasons. We had a solid team and were again in the top 4 of the league but ultimately didn’t have the right tools in the basket to get it done against a strong CBR team who beat us in the semis, 
             and then went on to lose to the Melbourne Ice who were sporting a 500 NHL Game veteran in David Booth, the most talented hockey player I've played against but also a cunt. What I didn’t know during the season was that the 2025 Perth Thunder season was my last, b
             ased on my new role at work. It really pains me to write that,  Thunder for better or worse has been a core part of my identity for the last 12 years, and I've centred my life around hockey as a whole for 17 years and thus some of my best friends in life are hockey guys. I don’t think I'll quit the game, I still enjoy it, I just couldn’t standby and let career opportunities pass for Thunder anymore. 
             I'm enormously grateful for what the game has given me and those who have coached me along the way, all the critical coaches in my career we're volunteers so I think its worth recognising: Dave Ruck, Darin Bryce, Debbie Strome, Markus and Jo Frankenburger and Ben Breault. The only people who did more than the coaches was my parents who forked out a shit load of time and money to support this dream. 
             I didn’t have a hell of a lot of talent but to get 12 years of playing like a dog at National and International level is something I'll always be very proud of.

            When I wasn’t playing hockey or working the winter in Perth was the worst for weather I had seen in a while, I believe it was the worst since 1996 with regards to total rainfall. To make it worse I did have a European summer trip planned to get to Jasper and Chloes wedding, unfortunately the nature of the beast that is a moving drilling schedule lined up the well I had been working on for month dead smack in the middle of the wedding meaning I ultimately had to stay in Perth. I had terrible FOMO but probably made the right call to keep my job. Luckily through some misfortune I was able to catchup with Jasper in August! 
            <br><br>
            In August my grandfather on my mums side passed away, we've never been close to my mums side of the family, but luckily I did visit him in early 2024 (the only time I visited him in my adult life). I went to the funeral mainly to support my mum as I realised losing the last member of her family would be tough and the drama that comes with settling that all out is even tougher. Immediately after the funeral dust had settled I went to Budapest for a long weekend with Jasper (who is living in Amsterdam) which was a big highlight of the year, we explored the cities pubs, attended a party at an old castle and went to Sziget (music festival), along the way we had a range of weird and wonderful side characters who all brought something to the trip. Overall I love that Jasper and I just picked up exactly where we left off depsite not seeing each other that regularly these days.

            Its probably time to discuss one of the great things that happened in late 2024 that carried over into 2025 but also one of the more challenging things. I met Sorcha, most of you would have met this bubbly, beautiful and incredibly caring Irish doctor. I learnt many things and met many great people through dating Sorcha and even got back into tennis! But in mid 2025 the issues we were ignore really started to come to light and create cracks in the relationship. The driving fact being she never wanted to settle in Australia and always wanted to return to Ireland - I initially ignored this and thought it would change as it does for many Irish immigrants in Australia. In June after feeling homesick for the majority of time she was in Perth, she returned home for a month long visit and this firmed up for sure she would be returning home in the following year. I instantly started withdrawing to the point where we almost broke up in July, but we decided to keep it going and keep it light as we enjoyed each others company and the relationship still was going well.
             From here I felt like I continued to always make the compromises to try make everything work even when the end was inevitable. So what I did next was apply for a job that interested me, going to work on the Trion project with Woodside in Mexico, going back to the rig as a Wellsite engineer - which is the same role I did in Houston in 2022. I found out I got the job in mid October, 
             This accelerated the beginning of the end of us but I'd be kicking myself if I didn’t go for an opportunity only to suffer the same fate a few months later when she left for Ireland (original was June now is Late Feb), and despite how awesome she was I don’t think we were compatible long term. I really hope everything works out for her at home as all of you know she is a great person who deserves the best.

            <br><br>
            Around a similar time I also had a 2 great friends depart Perth for their next adventures:
              <br><br>
            Jamie Campbell and Samara moved to London in a now or never moment. I'll miss our regular brunch and walks and Subi, sessions at the bowlo->JBs->Pica and the overall energy Jamie brings to anything he does one of my favourite examples of this is how hard Jamie got around thunder and AIHL finals this season after only retiring a season a go. Looking forward to many more years of supporting the boys when we are both back and retired.

            Dan is living it up as a tax free, big dog lawyer in Dubai where his partner Dani also got a dream job stepping away from law and into the arts. Selfishly I miss them to bits, but I'm so happy that its worked out as I know they've wanted this for a while. Dan and I have been incredibly close friends for many years now and hes often the first person I call about anything. I think we both also improved as mates for each other this year carving out plenty of time to hang out by going to the Sauna at Melt @ 5am or playing ridiculous amounts of golf.

            Golf, lets talk about it for a second. I love that all our mates play now, it gives us a great reason to get outside and hangout regularly something we were struggling to do for a while. I love that we all suck and have handicaps > 25 but still have fun all the same. It brings people together, I've played with my school mates/hockey mates a lot but also work colleagues, my mum and others I don’t see so often. I'm hoping to play even more next year, so hit me up, and I've only just started fixing my slice later in the year. THANK GOD.

            I feel like this year I went on a lot of epic trips often ending up with assorted crews, but in Late October and November after I delivered my final wells to the SCA project I took a month off to attend Dani and Alexs wedding in Colombia before travelling on to Vietnam to meet Sorcha. Not the most co-located holidays but at the time of booking I was still really  trying to give the Sorcha thing a shot. Theres gonna be a lot about this trip for the wedding, as it was unreal. Alex is an aussie drilling engineer I met at Woodside and became close with in 2021. Dan is a Colombian born, Teas raised travel nurse. They met surfing on the beaches of Dakar, Senegal. Fucking West Africa. Alex was there working for Woodside doing some drill baby drill, and Dani was there being much more wholesome, she was part of the Mercy Ships (google it, there's a YouTube documentary) which is  crew of medical volunteers on a boat that sails around Africa treating people for more obscure surgeries e.g. removing hectic tumors and fixing deformities. This set the scene for a wedding in Colombia complete with 2 weeks of festivities where I really only knew 2 guys from work and the bride and groom, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. But man did the entire trip and the people blow me away, We spent 4 days in Cartagena as a big group where got to know each other. Key highlight/lowlight (depending on how you look at it) was observing Alexs fantastic Spanish skills in a high stakes negotiation a bill when we had clearly been ripped off on an island, they reckon 15 of us drank 100 beers and 30 cocktails in an hour, an impressive feat.

            After the pre wedding celebrations in Cartagena people split off to do their own things, I ended up joining a group from the Mercy Ship to visit the coffee region Salento, I was nervous about this as I only knew one person Steph (whom I had met in whistler in January), but those worries were quickly put to bed with how awesome and accepting the group was. We did some awesome touristy things like riding horse through the Corcora valley and going on coffee tour but a big highlight was playing "fishbowl" which was a common game from the Mercy Ships which is kind of like a DIY charades allowing you to use inside jokes and custom prompts, I was laughing till my lungs ached.

            After the coffee region we headed back to the Bogota for more festivities then mobilised up to Sopo in the mountains for a spectacular wedding that words cant describe at a historic old polo club. I've put some photos below but we were surrounded by amazing people most of who were strangers 2 weeks ago we're now sharing multiple inside jokes ("Just a couple of cowboys"), meaningful connections and the salsa'd the night away giving the bar a huge nudge. Usually at a wedding you're always trying to flag down the bartender, this wedding I was scared the bartender was hunting us down every 15 mins with another shot of aguardiente.

            The next day I hauled my hungover ass into a sketchy/bumpy 2 hour car ride from Sopo to Bogota, Flew from Bogota to Madrid to Doha to Hanoi to begin a 2 week Vietnam adventure with Sorcha. We spend  couple of days in Hanoi (the north) exploring the old city, eating amazing bun cha and Bahn Mi, haggling with vendors for Arcteryx jackets and making day tips to Ha Long Bay and Nihn Bihn. From there we headed to the Ha Giang Loop, a 4 day motorcycle journey through the mountains of northern Vietnam. Whilst I has become quite a touristy activity it doesn’t detract from the landscapes and rural nature of the areas you pass through and I would highly recommend this to anyone, it is a perfect thing to do for solo travellers as well as the groups were great. We rounded out the trip in Ho Chi Mihn City or Saigon (southern Vietnam) which was much more affluent and built up and is a SE Asian finance hub. Despite the whole country being communist now there was a stark difference between the Hanoi in the north and Saigon in the south. I'd definitely go back and would highly encourage everyone to add it to their list. It was my first time travelling just Sorcha and I and it did start to expose more differences between us. Lesson learnt (which I thought I already knew): Travel with your partner as early as you can in your relationship.

            The run up to the new year was chaotic but not from the usual silly season party side (I recorded 0 ice cream factory visits this year what the hell?). Uncertainty and lack of support from HR on the Mexico job was killing me, we had to depart Perth Jan 4th and in classic woodside fashion nothing was sorted; contracts, T&Cs and visa were all up in the air. There was many discussions with my boss about me moving to Mexico City to rotate offshore from there, benefits being I could do 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off instead of 4 weeks at a time and I wouldn’t lose 4 days a hitch travelling. So both these options we're meant to be presented to me so I could assess what I wanted to do. In the end the only option presented to me for now  is 4 weeks on / 4 off rotating out of Perth with promise that everything will be re-evaluated once the project gets started. This project seems like everything is behind and last minute further adding to the stress. I'm in Mexico city now, and I just got my work visa so things are starting to work out but the future of 2026 still remains really uncertain on how it will all work out. This all going down in December during the inevitable end of my relationship with Sorcha also compounded everything. Hopefully its all for the best, but for the last week I've felt really uncertain about it all.

            Anyway as you can see by all the rambling above 2025 was massive and the tail end was filled with change. 2026 is going to be all about how I adapt to that change. But there's also some amazing plans and opportunities to look forward to. Some focus areas for me:
            <ul>
            <li>Establish a routine and stay disciplined on the rig. The loss of hockey and the move to FIFO life will be a big discipline change.</li> 
            <li>Make conscious, repeatable efforts to stay connected to my friends whilst away.</li>
            <li>Practice gratitude. </li>
            <li>Work on my Spanish.</li>
            <li>Continue to work through a coding course.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            I'm very thankful that every one of you was a part of the crazy year that was 2025, whether you knew it or not you all supported me through a range of circumstances, emotions and major changes. Whether I'm physically present or not please know I'm here for everyone of you and would love to hear from you throughout the great year that 2026 will be. 
            <br><br>
            Cheers,
            <br>
