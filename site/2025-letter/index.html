        <h2>2025 Annual Letter</h2>

        <p>Hola Amigos, <br><br>
          After a year hiatus the letter is back. For those new to the letter the concept is a year's recap, a bit of reflection to share with friends like an old school Christmas card of our parents' generation.
           Theres only two problems, its gonna be late and it’s a bit of ramble so bear with me. This year also takes a new format hosting it on my website
           and an accompanying spotify playlists of some of my favourite songs this year so press play enjoy the ride.

          <br>
          This years again is exceptionally late due the whirlwind of the back end of 2025 and start of 2026. 
          I write to you currently whilst on a day trip to the Mexican Embassy in Miami from Mexico city to get my work visa, 
          whilst on my first rotation to my new job in Mexico, but more on that later.
          <br> <br>
          2025 was a very rich year, I feel like there was so much and a lot of overseas trips to cover that this needs  disclaimer: 
          some of the time in Perth doesn’t get enough air time this year, but I still love being in Perth, I still live in West Perth despite bold ambitions to move to Subiaco,
           the favourite spots remain the same: The Bowlo West Leedy, JB orilleys for steak special and Bagelo Subiaco to mention a few. 
          <br> <br>
          The year opens up post NYE celebrations in Kendenup, WA camping on Grace's family farm with a gorgeous view of the Stirling ranges.
           To make it even better my lone friend from my time in the Lone star state, Cal was here to visit and had spent NYE celebrating with my friends in this exceptional part of the world. 
           Cal departed shortly into the new year on a grand adventure before starting a new job in Stamford, Connecticut just north of NYC - where I need to return the favour and visit!

           Q1 was rather electric, I was away on a lot of trip and I was in a phase of making merchandise for some of these group trips/milestone events.  
           First up was a long weekend in Bali for Liam Gallaghers Bucks, which was a hectic 4 days. Getting to some of Liams friends from Brisbane where he now resides was great but 
           I'll never forget meeting his rogue mate Tom. It was something you'd expect from Trevor out of GTA 5, I walked into the villa and this rouge bloke with a mullet was shooting fireworks at the groom. I instantly knew I was in for a weekend of debauchery. I had also made some custom kits for the group based on Celtic soccer jersey which were a conversation starter for sure. Golf, Bintangs, late night villa hangs, pit vipers, shit kits, Finns, terrible bartering skills and too many visits to Hotel Mexicola, and 1x dislocated shoulder.  That pretty much sums it up. 
          <br><br>
            2 weeks later we had squeezed in Hottest 100 at Jivan's, an excellent Kaytranada gig and the final day of the rugby 7s before departing 
            on a 3 week ski trip to Canada. 
            <br><br>
            This ski trip is one of the major highlights of my year so there will be a bit of detail below. The original plan was to spend a week at Sun Peaks, BC to celebrate the 30th of a dear friend of mine Sam Rosser 
            and I build in as much skiing as I could to the entire trip. After an overnight in Sydney due to Weather, I was due to arrive a day later than planned to Whistler where I had assembled and assorted crew.
            Alex and Dani (travelling from Houston where Alex is working for woodside), Matt and Mel (acquaintances through Sam soon to become friends) and Steph (Lives in Vancouver friends with Dani from Mercy Ships Senegal). My late arrival and determination to ski
            resulted in me landing at 6am in Vancouver well refreshed after sleeping 14hrs straight, jumping on the 2hr bus and being on the slopes by 10am same day to rip Whistler for the first time. Conditions were average but the company was excellent, one of my core memories will started a random snowball fight down the main street giggling/gasping for air the whole way home. 
            It was such a lovely time with an assorted group that even featured Jackson (another woodside colleague who happened to be in town) and his rogue mate from Karratha. Then two real pivotal events happened: 
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Alex and Dani got engaged!</li>
              <li>It started dumping snow for our last day.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            Now look I get it engagements are important but Dani and Alex y'all can wait till the end of this letter for this spotlight, you got engaged and married in the same year. 
            <br><br>
            The last day skiing in whistler was superb and I was very lucky to have 2 very keen skiers also present, Steph and Matt were both excellent skiers who realised this was the chance. We were up very early, waited in line for the lifts had a mammoth day on the slopes, my knees and quads were begging for mercy.
